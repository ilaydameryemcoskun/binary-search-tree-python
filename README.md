# Binary Search Tree (Python)

This project is a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** implementation developed in **Python** as part of a **Data Structures** course.

The application runs in the terminal and allows users to interactively create and analyze a binary search tree using fundamental tree operations.

---

##  Features

- Insert values into the binary search tree
- Search for a specific value
- Tree traversals:
  - Inorder
  - Preorder
  - Postorder
- Calculate tree height
- Count total number of nodes
- User input via terminal

---

##  Technologies & Concepts

- Python
- Data Structures
- Binary Search Tree
- Recursion
- Algorithmic thinking

##  How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Run the program using the terminal:

```bash
python bst.py
Enter values as prompted to build the tree
Select operations from the menu displayed in the terminal
